Using data mining and data visualization techniques to classify the patients having heart disease from those who are healthy. We will use various classification techniques or data models for the classification like Decision Tree Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier(kNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and compare them using evaluation metrices.
